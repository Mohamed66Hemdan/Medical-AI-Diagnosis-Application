# Medical-AI-Diagnosis-Application
A comprehensive AI-powered web application for medical diagnosis, built with Streamlit, featuring three advanced predictive models:
  - Stroke Risk Prediction
  - Liver Disease Stage Classification (3 stages)
  - Brain Tumor Detection (CT & MRI images)
    
The project integrates data preprocessing, EDA, model training with hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and deployment, making it a complete AI solution for healthcare analytics.

# Features
## 1. Stroke Risk Prediction

- XGBoost (best performing model with 98% accuracy)

Techniques applied:
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Grid Search hyperparameter tuning
- K-Fold Cross Validation for robust evaluation

## 2. Liver Disease Stage Classification
Classifies liver disease into three stages based on clinical data.

Models used:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoost (best performing model with 91% accuracy)

Techniques applied:
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
